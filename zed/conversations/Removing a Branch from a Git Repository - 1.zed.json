If you've already pushed the branch to your remote repository, you'll need to use the `-D` option instead.\n\nHere are the commands:\n\n**Removing a local branch:**\n\n```bash\ngit branch -d <branch_name>\n```\n\nReplace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to delete.\n\n**Removing a remote branch:**\n\n```bash\ngit push origin --delete <branch_name>\n```\n\nAgain, replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to delete. This will delete the branch from your remote repository, but only if it's not checked out locally.\n\nNote that if you've never pushed the branch to a remote repository and you're trying to delete it, Git won't allow you to do so unless you use the `-D` option:\n\n```bash\ngit branch -D <branch_name>\n```\n\nThis will force-delete the local branch.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"system","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":2}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":1},"start":2,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":4},"start":65,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":6}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5},"start":947,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5}}}],"summary":"Removing a Branch from a Git Repository","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
